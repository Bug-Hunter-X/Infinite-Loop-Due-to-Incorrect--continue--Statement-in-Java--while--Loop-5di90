# Infinite Loop Bug in Java 'while' Loop

This repository demonstrates a common coding error in Java involving the `continue` statement within a `while` loop. The code intends to print numbers 0 through 9, excluding 5. However, due to an incorrect placement of the loop counter increment (`i++`), it results in an infinite loop.

The `BuggyWhileLoop.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `CorrectedWhileLoop.java` provides the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of careful loop control and the potential pitfalls of misusing `continue`.
